# unsourced-sentences
This package allows you to surround text in <</>> (by default) to mark text as containing unsourced claims (or whatever else you want).
Such text will then be highlighted, and M-x unsourced-sentence-list will provide a list of unsourced sentences in the current buffer.
While highlighting an entry, you can press RET to jump to it, or s to search for the entry online.
